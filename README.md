# New York Citibike Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to use data from New York City's Citi Bike analysis to implement a similar project in De Moines, Iowa.
The analysis was conducted using Python's pandas library to clean up the data and Tableau for data visualizations. 

## Results

The analysis answered four main points:

1. Length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Where are they biking to and from?
4. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

### Length of time that bikes are checked out 

The graph shows the length of time for every bike ride during the month of August demonstrating most bike rides are between 2 and 15 minutes.

### Length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender

The graph shows the length of time for every bike ride during the month of August showing most bike rides are conducted by men.

To further support this graph, the visualization below shows that the most common user is a male subscriber.

### What are the most common starting and ending points?

The maps below show the top locations where riders are biking from and to. The first thing to note is that most rides start in the most populous areas in mid and lower Manhattan. Second, due to shorter ride times, the ending locations are also in those same populous areas.

### When are riders using the bikes?

The visualizations below shows bike usage follows a traditional commuting time of high peaks during 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm  during the week whereas weekends have a gradual use throughout the day.

To further these findings, this visualization shows a similar patterns when broken down between genders.

## Summary

Based on above analysis, to create a succesful citi bike program in De Moines, we should be concentrating on the following: 

1. Targeting men as they are the main user demographic
2. Position bikes in the most used areas
3. Offering incentives during traditional cummuting hours during the week to make bikes more accessible
